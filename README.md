# Custom Post Builder For Divi 

> Note: [Custom Post Builder Plugin](https://www.mrkwp.com/wp/custom-post-builder-plugin/) is now deprecated. Divi has introduced [Theme Builder](https://www.elegantthemes.com/documentation/divi/the-divi-theme-builder/) support. Theme builder allows to create custom single’s and archive’s template. Since our plugin’s functionality overlaps with divi’s we’ve decided to cease development on this plugin. We won't provide any support on this plugin.

## Description.
Associate a Divi Library item to a Custom Post Type’s single page template. Make full use of the Divi Page Builder to design your single pages.

Custom data populates your page template using field formatters and add_filter. We also included pre-baked field formatters for Advanced Custom Fields (ACF). Customizer settings for selecting templates for Custom Post Types is also available.

Map a Divi Library item to a WordPress single page template for a public post type. The Divi Library item post content renders for the post type’s single page.

Included is a Divi Module which helps you inject the dynamic data belonging to the post via a hook referred to as a field formatter. You also get a set of pre-defined field formatters that integrate with the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin.

### Other Features

* A Theme Customizer Panel where you can enable and select a Divi Library item to use when rendering the single page. Each post type has a Theme Customizer Panel. 
* A Divi Module to hook in the data for the post via field formatters for the Advanced Custom Field (ACF) plugin.
* A set of pre-defined field-formatters for ACF fields.
* The ability to define custom field formatter via a hook.
